# Presentation_website

The website was made as a university project with the help of two colleagues. The work distribution was pretty even but I mainly worked on the presentation page.

The website contains a first page with a slide show, a presentation page with some information about us and a contact page containing a form and a simple PHP script that echoes the input.
